# Music Popularity Prediction with Python

# Introduction

Music popularity prediction involves developing machine learning models to estimate the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features. Predicting the popularity of music can help music streaming platforms understand user preferences, optimize playlists and enhance recommendation systems to improve user engagement and satisfaction. 

## Music Popularity Prediction: Overview

Music popularity prediction means using regression techniques to forecast the popularity of songs based on various music features and metadata. Expected results include accurate predictions of a songâ€™s future performance in terms of streams, downloads, and chart positions, which enable music producers, artists, and marketers to make informed decisions.

To get started with music popularity prediction, we need a dataset of various songs with their musical features and historical data on how much popularity the songs got. I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes 227 music tracks, each described by their music features along with additional metadata like track name, artists, album name, and release date.
